The original patch was missing crucial error handling.  If the callable `self.path` raised an exception, the error would be swallowed. This revised patch adds a `try...except` block to re-raise the exception with a helpful message, similar to how exceptions were handled before the change. Additionally, it passes the instance as a keyword argument (`instance=self.instance`) to the callable, which is more robust and allows the callable to accept other arguments in the future without breaking compatibility.
