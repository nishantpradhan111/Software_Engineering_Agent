The original patch had a flaw where the `app_verbose_name` would be potentially incorrect. The `verbose_name` was fetched inside the loop and added to the dictionary only the first time a model from a given app was processed.  If the first model happened to *not* have an `app_config` with a `verbose_name` attribute, the dictionary entry for that app would retain `None` as the `app_verbose_name` even if other models from that same app *did* have a defined `verbose_name` in their `app_config`.

This revised patch fixes that issue by:

1. Checking `has_module_perms` first.
2. Initializing the `app_dict` entry for a new app *only once* when a model with `has_module_perms` is encountered for the first time.  The `verbose_name` is also fetched *at this point* and stored for the app.
3. Then, appending the model details to the `models` list.

This ensures that the `app_verbose_name` is consistently and correctly retrieved for each app, regardless of the order in which models are processed within the loop.
