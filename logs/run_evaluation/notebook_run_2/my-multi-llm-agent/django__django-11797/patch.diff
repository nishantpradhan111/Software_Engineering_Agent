The original patch was incorrect.  The issue is that the limit clause was being applied within the subquery, affecting the results *before* they were used by the outer query.  The solution is to remove the limit from the subquery entirely. The original patch attempted to fix this by passing `subquery=True` to the compiler.  However, this is not the correct approach. The `subquery` flag in `get_compiler` influences how the query is *rendered* (e.g., by wrapping it in parentheses), not how it is *constructed*. The limit clause is applied during the construction phase. Therefore, the correct fix is to simply remove the limits using `set_limits(high=None)` and *not* change how the subquery compiler is created.  The original, unpatched code was closer to the correct solution.
