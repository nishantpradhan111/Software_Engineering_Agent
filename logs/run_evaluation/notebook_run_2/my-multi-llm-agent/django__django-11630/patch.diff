The provided patch adds a `Meta` class with `db_table = 'app2_table_name'` to the `ModelName` class. This explicitly sets the database table name.  This is a valid approach to prevent Django's automatic table name generation (which would be `app2_modelname`).

However, the prompt doesn't specify the *exact* issue being addressed. If the issue is simply preventing Django's default naming convention, then the patch is correct. But if the issue is migrating an existing table with a different name, or ensuring compatibility with a specific naming scheme, the table name 'app2_table_name' might not be the correct one.  

Without knowing the original issue, it's hard to say definitively if 'app2_table_name' is the *right* name.  It's a plausible fix, but it might be too generic. A better table name might be something more descriptive, related to the model's purpose.  For example, if the model represents products, `app2_products` would be more informative.

Assuming the issue is simply avoiding the default `app2_modelname` and a more descriptive name is desired, here's a revised patch:
