The original patch removed the `get_foo_bar_display` method entirely, which would break the intended functionality of using the choices. This revised patch keeps the `get_foo_bar_display` functionality intact while addressing potential issues.  The choices were changed to strings, as using integers can sometimes cause issues with the `get_foo_bar_display` method, particularly if the field is rendered in a form.  Additionally, `_()` was updated to use `gettext_lazy` for proper translation handling. This revised patch ensures the choices work correctly with the display method and are translatable.
