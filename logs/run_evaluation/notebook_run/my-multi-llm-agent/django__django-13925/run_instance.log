|
|**Explanation:**
|
|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.
|
|**Alternative Solution (preferred for new projects):**
|
|If you are starting a new project, or are willing to migrate your database, the preferred solution is to set `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in your project's `settings.py` file:

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|**Alternative Solution (preferred for new projects):**

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|**Explanation:**
|
|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.
|
|**Alternative Solution (preferred for new projects):**

When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|**Explanation:**
|
|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|**Alternative Solution (preferred for new projects):**

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|**Alternative Solution (preferred for new projects):**

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.

|The issue arises because Django 3.2 introduced a new setting called `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.  When a model doesn't explicitly define a primary key field, Django uses this setting to determine the type of auto-created primary key.  Even if the parent model *does* define a primary key, the child models will still trigger this warning if they don't *explicitly* inherit it using `primary_key=True` on a field.
|
|The provided solution sets the `default_auto_field` attribute within the `AppConfig` of the affected app(s).  This tells Django which type of auto-field to use when one isn't explicitly specified. Setting it to `'django.db.models.AutoField'` maintains the previous behavior.
|
|**Alternative Solution (preferred for new projects):**
|
|If you are starting a new project, or are willing to migrate your database, the preferred solution is to set `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in your project's `settings.py` file:
