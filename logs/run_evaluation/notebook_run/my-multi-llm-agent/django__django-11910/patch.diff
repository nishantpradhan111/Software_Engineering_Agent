**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Corrected Model Field Name:** The `AlterField` operation was targeting the incorrect field name (`modela`). It should be `field_fk` as defined in the `ModelB` class.
2. **Corrected `to_field` Value:**  The `to_field` parameter in the `ForeignKey` field needed to be updated to the new primary key name, `field_fixed`.  It was incorrectly pointing to the old name, `field_wrong`.
3. **Corrected `to` Value:** The `to` parameter was incorrectly pointing to `app1.ModelB`. It should be `app1.ModelA` because the ForeignKey is referencing `ModelA`.


This corrected migration will now properly update the ForeignKey to point to the renamed primary key field.  It's crucial to ensure both the database schema and the model definition are synchronized after renaming a primary key, especially when other models depend on it via a ForeignKey.
