This patch addresses the issue in two ways:

1. **Improved `_delete_composed_index`:** The function now handles cases where both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields. It filters out non-index constraints when deleting, preventing the `ValueError`.

2. **Unique Temporary Names:** The `_generate_temp_name` function is introduced to create unique temporary names for indexes during renaming operations. This prevents conflicts when multiple constraints exist on the same fields, ensuring that the correct index is renamed and deleted.  This utilizes the constraint type as part of the name, guaranteeing uniqueness.

This approach ensures that deleting an `index_together` works correctly even when a `unique_together` exists on the same fields, resolving the original issue. It also avoids unnecessary index recreation during migrations.
