The issue stems from Sphinx's autodoc needing some minimal docstrings to properly process and resolve certain types, especially those from the standard library that might not have explicit cross-references readily available. Adding docstrings, even simple ones like "Consume a struct" and "Make a struct", provides enough context for Sphinx to correctly handle the `struct.Struct` type annotations.  This change ensures the functions are documented and allows Sphinx to resolve the type correctly.
