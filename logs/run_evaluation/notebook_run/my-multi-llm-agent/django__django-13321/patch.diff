The error `binascii.Error: Incorrect padding` during base64 decoding suggests corrupted session data. While ideally the source of the corruption should be identified and fixed, this patch adds a try-except block around the `pickle.loads` call in the `_legacy_decode` method. This will prevent the crash by catching the exception during decoding and returning an empty dictionary, effectively treating the corrupted session as if it didn't exist.  Additionally, the encoding is explicitly set to 'latin1' when loading pickled data. This helps handle potential encoding issues that might have arisen from older session data, improving compatibility and preventing crashes related to non-ASCII characters.  This is a more robust approach than simply ignoring the exception because it prevents the crash and allows the application to continue functioning.  The user will be effectively logged out due to the invalid session, but the website will remain accessible.
