|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.

|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.

|**Explanation of the fix:**
|
|The issue arises because `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object (from `pathlib`), while `runserver`'s auto-reloading mechanism expects strings in the `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` setting.  When `BASE_DIR` (a Path) is directly placed in the list, the change detection mechanism within the `runserver` command doesn't recognize modifications to files.
|
|The provided patch addresses this by conditionally converting `BASE_DIR` to a string using `.is_dir()`. This ensures compatibility with both scenarios:
|
|1. **Standard Django project:** `BASE_DIR` is a `Path` object, and the code converts it to a string path. This allows the auto-reloader to function correctly.
|2. **Other setups (e.g., tests, custom configurations):**  If `BASE_DIR` is not a directory path (e.g., a string), the code uses 'templates' as the directory, avoiding the issue of a non-existent directory.
|
|This solution maintains the desired functionality of using `BASE_DIR` for templates while ensuring the development server restarts as expected.
|
|
|**Alternative solution (using `os.path.join`)**
|
|Another approach is to use `os.path.join` to create the template directory path, which ensures a string representation:
