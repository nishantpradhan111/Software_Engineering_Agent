This patch addresses the "ValueError: embedded null byte" issue by adding a try-except block around the `path.resolve().absolute()` call.  If a `ValueError` occurs (indicating a null byte in the path), the path is simply skipped.  This prevents the error from halting the auto-reloading process.  The patch also handles the case where `__file__` is None, avoiding an AttributeError.

While this doesn't identify the *source* of the null byte, it prevents the error from occurring and allows auto-reloading to continue functioning.  This is a pragmatic approach given the intermittent nature of the issue and the difficulty in reproducing it.  A more thorough investigation into the root cause could be pursued separately, but this patch provides a working solution in the meantime.
