The issue is that Pylint's regex engine doesn't support the Unicode property escape `\p{Han}`.  The fix is to replace `\p{Han}` with the equivalent Unicode range `\u4e00-\u9fff`, which covers the majority of commonly used Han characters.  This range represents the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) portion of the Han script. While not perfectly equivalent to `\p{Han}`, it's a practical solution for most use cases.  If truly comprehensive Han character matching is required, a more advanced regex engine outside of Pylint's configuration would be necessary.
