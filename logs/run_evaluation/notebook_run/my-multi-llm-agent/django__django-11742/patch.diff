**Explanation of the changes:**

1. **Import ValidationError:** We import `ValidationError` to raise validation errors.

2. **`clean()` method:** We override the `clean()` method of the model. This method is called during model validation, before saving the object to the database.

3. **Calculate max choice length:** Inside `clean()`, we determine the maximum length of the choice values using a generator expression and the `max()` function.  `choice[0]` accesses the actual value of the choice (e.g., 'short', 'verylongchoice').

4. **Check against max_length:** We compare the calculated maximum choice length with the `max_length` attribute of the field.

5. **Raise ValidationError:** If `max_length` is too small, we raise a `ValidationError` with a descriptive message indicating the field name and the discrepancy in lengths.  This error will be displayed to the user and prevent the object from being saved.

**How to adapt to your specific code:**

* Replace `YourModel` with your actual model name.
* Replace `your_field` with the actual field name that has the `choices` and `max_length` attributes.
* Ensure the path in the diff (`path/to/your/models.py`) matches your project's structure.

**Important Note:** This solution checks the `max_length` against the *current* set of choices.  If you dynamically modify the choices (e.g., through a database table), you'll need to ensure this check is performed whenever the choices change.



This improved solution uses the field's own attributes (`self.your_field.field.choices` and `self.your_field.field.max_length`) to get the necessary information, making it more robust and less prone to errors.  It also provides a clear and informative error message.
