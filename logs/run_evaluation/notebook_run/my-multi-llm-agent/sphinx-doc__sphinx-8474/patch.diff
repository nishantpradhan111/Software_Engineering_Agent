**Explanation:**

The "WARNING: no number is assigned for table" message in Sphinx 3.3+ typically indicates that automatic numbering for tables (and figures) is disabled.  The `numfig` configuration option controls this behavior. By setting `numfig = True` in your `conf.py` file, you enable automatic numbering for figures, tables, and code-blocks. This should resolve the warning.

**Note:** Replace `XX` with the appropriate line number in your `conf.py` file where you add your extensions. If `numfig` already exists and is set to `False`, simply change it to `True`. If the warning persists after this change, please provide more context, such as a minimal reproducible example, including the relevant RST source file and your Sphinx version.  There might be other factors at play, like custom CSS or extensions interfering with numbering.
