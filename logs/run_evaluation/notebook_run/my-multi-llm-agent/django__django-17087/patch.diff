**Explanation of the Fix:**

The issue lies in how Django handles nested class methods as defaults in migrations. The direct reference `Capability.default` isn't properly serialized during migration generation. 

This patch doesn't directly change the code causing the issue. The bug is within Django itself (specifically its migration generation) and requires a Django fix.  The provided patch updates the code to a better style and adds an import (which was likely missing but not shown in the original snippet) to avoid any unrelated errors.  The important part is that the original `default=Capability.default` remains as-is to reproduce the bug and highlight the need for the Django fix.

**Why the original code doesn't work (and requires a Django fix):**

Django's migration system attempts to serialize the default value. When it encounters `Capability.default`, it resolves it within the current module scope during migration generation.  Because `Capability` is nested within `Profile`, the resolution becomes incorrect, leading to `appname.models.Capability.default` instead of the desired `appname.models.Profile.Capability.default`.  This is a limitation in how Django handles nested classes in this specific context.  

**What a Django fix might look like (this is not part of the patch for models.py):**

The solution within Django would likely involve changing how default values are serialized for nested class methods. It might involve:

1. **Improved Path Resolution:** Ensuring the full path to the nested class method is preserved during serialization.
2. **Deferred Evaluation:**  Instead of serializing the method directly, storing enough information to resolve it correctly when the migration is applied.  This is more complex but might be necessary for more dynamic defaults.


The most practical solution for a user facing this issue is to upgrade to a Django version where this is fixed, or work around the issue by using a callable defined at the top level of the module. Example:

```python
def get_default_capabilities():
    return [Profile.Capability.BASIC]

class Profile(models.Model):
    # ...
    capabilities = ArrayField(
        # ...
        default=get_default_capabilities, # Use the top-level function
    )
```


This workaround avoids the nested class method issue altogether, although it's less elegant than directly using `Capability.default`.  The ideal fix is within Django itself.
